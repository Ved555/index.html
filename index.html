    <p3> "Setting up Visual Studio Code
        Getting up and running with Visual Studio Code is quick and easy. It is a small download so you can install in a matter of minutes and give VS Code a try.
        
        Cross platform#
        VS Code is a free code editor, which runs on the macOS, Linux, and Windows operating systems.
        
        Follow the platform-specific guides below:
        
        macOS
        Linux
        Windows
        VS Code is lightweight and should run on most available hardware and platform versions. You can review the System Requirements to check if your computer configuration is supported.
        
        Update cadence#
        VS Code releases a new version each month with new features and important bug fixes. Most platforms support auto updating and you will be prompted to install the new release when it becomes available. You can also manually check for updates by running Help > Check for Updates on Linux and Windows or running Code > Check for Updates on macOS.
        
        Note: You can disable auto-update if you prefer to update VS Code on your own schedule.
        
        Insiders nightly build#
        If you'd like to try our nightly builds to see new features early or verify bug fixes, you can install our Insiders build. The Insiders build installs side-by-side with the monthly Stable build and you can freely work with either on the same machine. The Insiders build is the same one the VS Code development team uses on a daily basis and we really appreciate people trying out new features and providing feedback.
        
        Portable mode#
        Visual Studio Code supports Portable mode installation. This mode enables all data created and maintained by VS Code to live near itself, so it can be moved around across environments, for example, on a USB drive. See the VS Code Portable Mode documentation for details.
        
        Additional components#
        VS Code is an editor, first and foremost, and prides itself on a small footprint. Unlike traditional IDEs that tend to include everything but the kitchen sink, you can tune your installation to the development technologies you care about. Be sure to read the Additional Components topic after reading the platform guides to learn about customizing your VS Code installation.
        
        Extensions#
        VS Code extensions let third parties add support for additional:
        
        Languages - C++, C#, Go, Java, Python
        Tools - ESLint, JSHint , PowerShell
        Debuggers - Chrome, PHP XDebug.
        Keymaps - Vim, Sublime Text, IntelliJ, Emacs, Atom, Visual Studio, Eclipse
        Extensions integrate into VS Code's UI, commands, and task running systems so you'll find it easy to work with different technologies through VS Code's shared interface. Check out the VS Code extension Marketplace to see what's available.
        
        Next steps#
        Once you have installed and set up VS Code, these topics will help you learn more about VS Code:
        
        Additional Components - Learn how to install Git, Node.js, TypeScript, and tools like Yeoman.
        User Interface - A quick orientation to VS Code.
        Basic Editing - Learn about the powerful VS Code editor.
        Code Navigation - Move quickly through your source code.
        Debugging - Debug your source code directly in the VS Code editor.
        Proxy Server Support - Configure your proxy settings.

        Common questions#
        What are the system requirements for VS Code?#
        We have a list of System Requirements.
        
        How big is VS Code?#
        VS Code is a small download (< 100 MB) and has a disk footprint of less than 200 MB, so you can quickly install VS Code and try it out.
        
        How do I create and run a new project?#
        VS Code doesn't include a traditional File > New Project dialog or pre-installed project templates. You'll need to add additional components and scaffolders depending on your development interests. With scaffolding tools like Yeoman and the multitude of modules available through the npm package manager, you're sure to find appropriate templates and tools to create your projects.
        
        How do I know which version I'm running?#
        On Linux and Windows, choose Help > About. On macOS, use Code > About Visual Studio Code.
        
        Why is VS Code saying my installation is Unsupported?#
        VS Code has detected that some installation files have been modified, perhaps by an extension. Reinstalling VS Code will replace the affected files. See our FAQ topic for more details.
        
        How can I do a 'clean' uninstall of VS Code?#
        If you want to remove all user data after uninstalling VS Code, you can delete the user data folders Code and .vscode. This will return you to the state before you installed VS Code. This can also be used to reset all settings if you don't want to uninstall VS Code.
        
        The folder locations will vary depending on your platform:
        
        Windows - Delete %APPDATA%\Code and %USERPROFILE%\.vscode.
        macOS - Delete $HOME/Library/Application Support/Code and ~/.vscode.
        Linux - Delete $HOME/.config/Code and ~/.vscode." </p>

        <p3 > "The Browser Console is like the Web Console, but applied to the whole browser rather than a single content tab.

            So it logs the same sorts of information as the Web Console - network requests, JavaScript, CSS, and security errors and warnings, and messages explicitly logged by JavaScript code. However, rather than logging this information for a single content tab, it logs information for all content tabs, for add-ons, and for the browser's own code.
            
            If you also want to use the other web developer tools in the regular Web Toolbox with add-on or browser code, consider using the Browser Toolbox.
            
            Similarly, you can execute JavaScript expressions using the Browser Console. But while the Web Console executes code in the page window scope, the Browser Console executes them in the scope of the browser's chrome window. This means you can interact with all the browser's tabs using the gBrowser global, and even with the XUL used to specify the browser's user interface.
            
            NB: The Browser Console command line (to execute JavaScript expressions) is disabled by default. To enable it set the devtools.chrome.enabled preference to true in about:config, or set the "Enable browser chrome and add-on debugging toolboxes" (Firefox 40 and later)  option in the developer tool settings.
            
            Opening the Browser Console
            You can open the Browser Console in one of two ways:
            
            from the menu: select "Browser Console" from the Web Developer submenu in the Firefox Menu (or Tools menu if you display the menu bar or are on macOS).
            from the keyboard: press Ctrl+Shift+J (or Cmd+Shift+J on a Mac).
            You can also start the Browser Console by launching Firefox from the command line and passing the -jsconsole argument:
            
            /Applications/FirefoxAurora.app/Contents/MacOS/firefox-bin -jsconsole
            The Browser Console looks like this:
            
            
            
            You can see that the Browser Console looks and behaves very much like the Web Console:
            
            most of the window is occupied by a pane that display messages.
            at the top, a toolbar enables you to filter the messages that appear.
            at the bottom, a command line interpreter enables you to evaluate JavaScript expressions.
            Beginning with Firefox 68, the Browser Console allows you to show or hide messages from the content process (i.e. the messages from scripts in all the opened pages) by setting or clearing the checkbox labeled Show Content Messages. The following image shows the browser console focused on the same page as above after clicking on the Show Content Messages checkbox.
            
            
            
            Browser Console logging
            The Browser console logs the same sorts of messages as the Web Console:
            
            HTTP requests
            Warnings and errors (including JavaScript, CSS, security warnings and errors, and messages explicitly logged by JavaScript code using the console API)
            Input/output messages: commands send to the browser via the command line, and the result of executing them
            However, it displays such messages from:
            
            web content hosted by all browser tabs
            the browser's own code
            add-ons
            " </p>
    <script>    
       console.log("My first console project");
       console.log("My name is ")
       var firstName = "Ved ";
       var lastName = "de Melo";
       console.log(firstName + lastName);
       var num1 = 12
       var num2 = 55
       console.log(num1 + num2);
       console.log(num1 - num2);
       console.log(num2 * num1);
